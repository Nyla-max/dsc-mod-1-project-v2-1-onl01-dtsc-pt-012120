## Module 1 Project 
   Hello, my name is Nyla Duperval and this is my Module 1 Project.


## Lights, Camera, ACTION! 

   Since the 1890s, the film industry has provided a gateway to learning, communion and exploration. With the advancement of technology, the film industry has changed specifically the monetary input. A successful file requires a successful a team of writers, cinematographers, editors etc. To determine if Microsoft should enter the film industry, letâ€™s take a look at how much does it will cost to make a successful movie. Success will be determined by the comparison of production budget and gross (domestic & worldwide).
   
   
## Data Cleaning

   First, I have cleaned the data within the dataframe imported. I created a column to specify only the year of a movie release for easier indexing. I also removed the column 'id' and 'release_date'. The dataset did not have any NaN values. I checked for duplicates which showed movies with similar or the same movie title but we're release different years. Within the movie industry, movie remakes are common and can have very large timeframes.


## Data Exploration 

   Through my exploration of the data, I separated my data into two focus groups: 
        Focus group 1: Movies with a domestic and worldwide gross
        Focus group 2: Movies without a domestic and worldwide gross

   I thought this was important to seperate in order to compare the budgets to those whom gained revenue and those whom did not. The first focus group showed a large dataset of 5234 movies while the second focus group showed 367 movies. Based on this information, there were more movies with a form of revenue than those without any earned. Since the technological advancements that have occurred rapidly within the movie industry, I decided to focus on last 5 years to gather an accurate picture of the industry today. 


## Conclusion

   The largest average budget in focus group 1 was approximately 100 million dollars while the lowest average budget was approximately 16 million dollars. Between 2015-2018, the worldwide gross average was substantial higher than production budget average. However, there is a small margin between production budget average and domestic gross average. This can suggest within the United States there is a decrease in movie-goers or other outside factors contributing to the amount of revenue generated. In 2019, there was a large decrease in worldwide and domestic gross averages compared to production budget averages. In focus group 2, the largest average budget was approximately 100 million dollars and the lowest average budget was approximately 2 million dollars. Based on data observed, production budget average increased by year. This can be alarming if the this trend of increasing production budget per year, there is a higher risk of loss of revenue. 

   My recommendation is to pursue a business venture into the movie industry. The movie industry is a lucrative business that is not confined to the walls of a movie theatre. Even though our world is increasing toward online networks, these streaming sites, such as Netflix, have began creating original content for their subscribers. With film awards shows recognizing these type of films, it shows the movie industry is not disappearing but a new form of "movies" are begin created. However, I believe further research will be needed before making a commit to pursue this venture. 
   
   First, we must look more into production budgets and the components. There are many entities involved in a production budget and understanding what these requirements can help understand any trends in production budgets. We must look more into if there is additional information avaliable to dtermine why there was such a decrease in revenue in 2019. This will give us a better understanding of factors that could have a negative effect on future movie ventures. Also, I recommend researching online streaming sites production budgets and understanding how they receive revenue. Does their revenue count as subscriptions made following the release of a certain project etc. Lastly, we must look deeper into movies whom did not collect revenue and the reasoning. Within the movie industry, movies under-go different stages to determine if it will actually be released in theatres. Unfornately, I was unable to do further research to confirm if all these movies actually were shown in movie theatre. This can assist with understand what these production teams did and how we can learn from their mistakes and accomplishments. 
   
   With this additional information I recommend we collect, it can either support or disagree with my decision to pursue a venture within the movie industry. Gathering the whole picture is best to do in order to make the best business decisions.
